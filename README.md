# slop-family-album

Local-first desktop app for building printed family photo albums and seasonal-memory wall calendars from a year of family photos.

## Status

**Phase 1 (Foundation) — complete.** App indexes a folder into SQLite with thumbnails + EXIF and shows the library as a grid.

**Phase 2a (CV pipeline) — complete.** Python sidecar runs blur + face detection + perceptual hash on every indexed photo. Duplicate groups are detected via pHash Hamming distance. Library grid shows blur, face count, and dup-group indicators per thumbnail.

Phase 2b (embeddings + scene tags + face clustering), Phase 3 (selection + layout), and Phase 4 (PDF export + LLM captions) are planned but not yet implemented.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-family-album-builder-design.md` for the design.

## Development

Requires: Node ≥ 20, Rust toolchain (for Tauri v2), Python ≥ 3.11, `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), `libheif` if you want HEIC support (`brew install libheif` on macOS).

```bash
npm install
cd sidecar && npm install && cd ..
cd py-sidecar && uv sync && cd ..
npm run tauri dev
```

Run sidecar tests:

```bash
cd sidecar && npm test
```

Run Python sidecar tests:

```bash
cd py-sidecar && uv run pytest
```

Run Rust tests:

```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```

UI smoke (non-Tauri):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Architecture

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-family-album-builder-design.md`.

Short version: Tauri v2 shell + SvelteKit renderer + SQLite + Node sidecar (Sharp + ExifTool) + Python sidecar (OpenCV + imagehash). All data stays local.
